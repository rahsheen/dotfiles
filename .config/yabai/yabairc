# Example: automatically tile new windows
# This should be the default, but explicitly setting it doesn't hurt
yabai -m config auto_balance on

# You can add rules for specific applications if you want them to behave differently
# Example: Make Calculator float instead of tiling
yabai -m rule --add app="^Calculator$" manage=off
