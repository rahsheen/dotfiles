# Example: automatically tile new windows
# This should be the default, but explicitly setting it doesn't hurt
yabai -m config auto_balance on

# You can add rules for specific applications if you want them to behave differently
# Example: Make Calculator float instead of tiling
yabai -m rule --add app="^Calculator$" manage=off

# Important: Do NOT include lines related to --load-sa or scripting additions
# if you are not disabling SIP, as these will not work and may cause errors.

# Set Obsidian to always float and be sticky (visible on all spaces)
yabai -m rule --add app="^Obsidian$" manage=off
